# Session handoff — 2026-10-05

Written at the end of the WSL-side session, for the next session running on **Windows + VS Code**.
Anything below is **measured** (a command was run and its output read) unless explicitly marked
**unverified**.

## Why this handoff exists

The dev environment is moving off VS Code's WSL remote. A BYOK model is not selectable for WSL
workspaces — upstream `microsoft/vscode#332085`, acknowledged as not-user-error and backlogged with
no fix intent. Step debugging is a standing requirement, so this is not optional.

Target: **Windows VS Code with all PHP inside Docker** — step debugging, PHPUnit and Infection
included — backed by each repo's `compose.yml`, so developers without VS Code use the identical
environment through plain `docker compose`.

## The first thing to know: the standing rules do not follow you

The user-memory files that constrain how work is done here live under
`/home/jsmith/.vscode-server/data/User/globalStorage/github.copilot-chat/memory-tool/memories/` —
that is **WSL VS Code server storage**. On the Windows side they will be absent (or hold different
content). The rules below are therefore copied in here deliberately; do not rely on memory being
present. Where they came from is noted so they can be re-established.

## Measured state at handoff

- Every repo under `~/github.com/webinertia` is on its default branch and in sync with `origin`.
- **Docker Desktop is the engine, and it is shared between Windows and WSL.** `docker context ls`
  shows `desktop-linux` → `npipe:////./pipe/dockerDesktopLinuxEngine`; `/var/run/docker.sock` exists
  in WSL; `docker info` reports `os=Docker Desktop`, server `29.8.1`, driver `overlayfs`. A compose
  file behaves identically from either side — no compose rewrite is needed for parity.
- `webware/Dockerfile` installs **pcov and xdebug**, but **xdebug cannot debug as shipped**: the ini
  it writes sets `xdebug.mode=off`. `webware/.vscode/launch.json` debugs the app with "Listen for
  Xdebug", which attaches to the *already-running* app server — a process VS Code did not start, so
  the only xdebug configuration it ever sees is the ini. A shell `XDEBUG_MODE` export cannot reach
  it. The mode therefore has to be in the ini
  (`/usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/docker-php-ext-xdebug.ini`, written by the Dockerfile):
  `xdebug.mode=debug`, `xdebug.start_with_request=yes`, `xdebug.client_host=host.docker.internal`.
- `XDEBUG_MODE` **replaces** the ini's mode, it does not merge with it (measured: ini `debug` plus
  `XDEBUG_MODE=coverage` gives active modes `["coverage"]`, `debug` dropped). So the ini can hold
  `debug` for step debugging while a coverage run stays clean: `XDEBUG_MODE=coverage` for coverage,
  `XDEBUG_MODE=off` for a zero-overhead run. `XDEBUG_CLIENT_HOST` does **not** work (measured);
  `XDEBUG_CONFIG="client_host=..."` does.
- With the ini at `debug` and `start_with_request=yes`, every process that does not set the env tries
  the 9003 connection, prints *"Xdebug: [Step Debug] Could not connect to debugging client"* to
  stderr, and blocks for `xdebug.connect_timeout_ms` (default 200 ms). `xdebug.connect_timeout_ms=25`
  in the same ini keeps that off the critical path for composer, phpunit and infection.
- **`pdo_mysql` is NOT in the tooling image.** Measured inside `webware-tooling:dev`:
  `PDO::getAvailableDrivers()` returns `["sqlite"]`; `pdo_mysql` false, `mysqli` false. PHP in that
  container cannot open a MySQL connection at all, so nothing DB-backed can run in it. The DB-backed
  siblings already carry the fix — `webware-acl`, `webware-core`, `webware-log` and
  `webware-usermanager` each add `pdo_mysql` to their own Dockerfile; only the DB-less repos and the
  `webware-tools` preset artifact omit it.
- **`vendor/webware/*` are relative symlinks that point outside the mounted tree.**
  `webware/composer.json` declares `path` repositories (`../webware-*`, `../message-bus`,
  `../traccio`) with `symlink: true`, so `vendor/webware/webware-acl` is a symlink to
  `../../../webware-acl/`. Under a container that mounts only `.:/app`, that resolves to
  `/webware-acl`, which does not exist — **the app cannot boot in `tooling` as it is configured
  today.**
- `webware/Dockerfile` and `webware/.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` are **byte-identical to the
  `webware-tools` preset artifacts** (`presets/webware-alignment/artifacts/`) — they are
  preset-managed. Change them in `webware-tools` first; editing the local copy forks the template.
- `webware/compose.yml` is **repo-owned** and customised (`mysql`, `phpmyadmin`, `mailpit`, the
  `webware_app` database). Editing it forks nothing.
- `devcontainer.json` carries no environment of its own: `dockerComposeFile: ["../compose.yml"]`,
  `service: "tooling"`, `workspaceFolder`, extensions, nothing else. The compose file is the single
  source of truth — which is already the "Dev Container backed by compose" arrangement that was
  asked for.
- The `tooling` service publishes **no ports** and runs `command: sleep infinity`.
- Every script in `webware/composer.json` shells out to a host `php`: `serve`, `test`,
  `test-coverage`, `test-integration`, `mutation-test`.
- Watermark: `webware/1.0.x` at `af12336` (PR #29), `webware-usermanager/1.0.x` at `12ea198`
  (PR #83).

## Open decisions

**Already answered by measurement (2026-10-05) — do not re-open:**

- **The MySQL address from inside the container is `host.docker.internal`, port 3306.** Measured from
  a container on the `webware_default` network: `host.docker.internal:3306` OPEN, `127.0.0.1:3306`
  refused (that is the container itself), `mysql:3306` OPEN but forbidden — RULE 1 never lets PHP
  receive a service name. The rule's original rationale (PHP on the host cannot resolve `mysql`) no
  longer applies once PHP is containerised, but the rule stands.
- **The coverage driver is not a choice to make.** `XDEBUG_MODE` replaces the ini's mode wholesale,
  so the ini can sit at `debug` for step debugging and a coverage run remains clean.

**Still open — do not decide these unilaterally.** The user was explicit that this is their
environment and that the agent should not be making these calls.

1. **`xdebug.client_host` — the one unresolved value.** The ini must address whatever process listens
   on 9003. `host.docker.internal` is right when VS Code runs on Windows with the container as the
   remote; if the PHP Debug extension host runs *inside* the container — which is where a Dev
   Container puts it — the value must be `127.0.0.1`. That is reasoning about the extension host, not
   a measurement taken here.
2. **How the sibling components reach the container.** Per the symlink finding above,
   `vendor/webware/*` point outside the mounted tree and the app cannot boot in `tooling` as
   configured. The two candidates — mount the parent directory so the existing `path` repositories
   resolve, or replace them with `vcs` repositories and let composer clone into `vendor/` — are a
   real workflow trade-off: the local edit loop against a single-clone reproducible environment,
   which is what a Windows rebuild actually needs.
3. **Reaching the app.** Publishing `8080` on `tooling` in `compose.yml` gives both the Dev Container
   and plain-compose developers the port. Relying on VS Code's automatic port forwarding gives it
   only to the Dev Container, which is the parity break to avoid.
4. **Root-owned artifacts.** PHP in the container writes `.phpunit.cache/`, `clover.xml` and
   `infection.log` into the bind-mounted tree as root. That breaks host-side coverage runs and needs
   root to clean up. Running as the host UID, or redirecting the cache directory, belongs with
   whichever of the above is chosen.

## Loose ends found — none of them touched

- `webware/plan/webware-coordination-handoff-2026-09-30.md` — **untracked and superseded**. Its
  "NEXT TASK" and its "26 dirty files on `feat/app-acl-seeds`" state predate the merges that
  followed (that branch landed as PR #7). Left in place rather than committed, because committing it
  as-is would mislead the next reader. It also duplicates rules recorded here.
- `webware-usermanager/docs/agent-plan-admin-create-user.md` and
  `webware-usermanager/docs/plan-admin-create-user.md` — untracked, and duplicates of the tracked
  `plan/` copies (the first is byte-identical; the second differs only in one relative link).
  Leftovers from the docs → plan move in PR #83.
- A stash in `webware-htmx` (4 test fixture templates, one line each) and one in `webware-phpdb`
  (self-described "byte-identical copy of feat/schema-abstraction, pre-switch"). Local snapshots;
  neither is pushable as-is.
- `webware/.vscode/launch.json` — the configuration "Listen for Xdebug" depends on — is **gitignored**
  (`/.vscode` in the root `.gitignore`), so it will not travel to Windows either and has to be
  recreated there.
- ~30 open PRs across the org, nearly all Renovate lock-file maintenance. Not this session's work;
  left alone.

## Other open threads

- `webware-acl` **#44** — adopt `Webware\Core\Role`, drop the per-role proxies. Its `ForbiddenHandler`
  guest branch is blocked on a **design decision, not code**: `Forbidden` is not a statement about
  identity, and the branch asks `getIdentity()`. The question has to become an ACL question.
  Unresolved: which resource it asks about, and whether the guest redirect moves to
  `AuthorizationMiddleware`. `webware-acl#59` was also filed during this session.
- `webware-usermanager` RFCs **#84** and **#85** await decisions D1–D7 and D1–D5.
- **D4 of #85** asks for `ProprietaryInterface` on `webware-acl`'s `RouteResourceInterface`; it has
  no issue of its own yet.
- `webware-migration` is deliberately on hold — do not start it.
- `webware-acl/src/Acl.php` was open in the editor at handoff, but the working tree is clean; there
  is no in-progress edit there.

## Rules to carry forward

- **Never delete a file without the user's explicit approval.** Renames and moves count as deletions.
  If a file looks wrong, report it in one line and stop.
- **Every change lands through a PR.** Never push to a default or version branch. Releases and tags
  belong to the owner alone — never tag, never `gh release`.
- Commit identity is `Joey Smith <jsmith@webinertia.net>` (`git commit -s`). Never override the
  author or committer, and never derive an identity from the OS username.
- **Merge commits by default.** Decide each PR on its own merit, and state the reason *before*
  squashing.
- **Never hand PHP the compose service name `mysql` as a host.** Not on the host, not in a
  container, not on any platform.
- **Do not run anything that boots app code while the user's debug session is attached.** Check
  `ss -ltnp | grep -E ':(9000|9003)'` first. A stray PHP process can kill the session.
- Do not probe Packagist; use `git ls-remote --tags` and `gh release list`.
- Reply style: findings first, no closing recap or restatement, no option menus; say "measured"
  versus "inferred" honestly, and ask one narrow question when blocked.
